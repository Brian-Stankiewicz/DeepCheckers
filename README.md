# DeepCheckers
A Deep Learning Algorithm to learn to play checkers.

## Goals: 

1. Teach myself about "adversarial learning" through checkers.
2. Build a checker playing system that does "adversarial learning" by playing different versions of itself.
3. Utilize deep learning as the teaching method

## Foreseen challenges
1. How to build the representation space to support learning.
2. What is the cost function?
3. Does it even make sense to use Deep Learning for this. Would simple HMM or POMDP be more appropriate?
    1. I want to have a system that makes it's decision based upon the board patterns and not a "search" through the search space. I know that can be done, but I don't know how to do it from patterns.
