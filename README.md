# DeepCheckers
A Deep Learning Algorithm to learn to play checkers.

A "toy problem" that will use deep learning to try and learn to play checkers. It is different from the deep learning that I have used in the past because it is using state spaces rather than real values like images.

This will take some research to merge together Markov modelling with deep learning.
